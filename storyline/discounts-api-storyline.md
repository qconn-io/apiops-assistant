# Retail Inc. Discounts API Use-Case: Narrative-Style Story & Requirements

## 1. The Retail Inc. Storyline

### Company Background
Retail Inc. is a thriving retail and e-commerce company. With a growing online marketplace and a diverse product catalog (electronics, apparel, home goods, etc.), Retail Inc. has been experimenting with ways to engage and reward customers. They’ve seen competitors roll out sophisticated discount, coupon, and loyalty programs, and they don’t want to be left behind.

They decide to build a new **Discounts API** to power flexible promotions on their online marketplace. This storyline centers on the people, processes, and constraints that shape that new Discounts API.

### The Team & Characters

1. **Megan (Marketing Manager)**
   - Owns promotional campaigns, budgets, and marketing strategies.
   - Eager to launch a “Winter Wonderland” campaign with sitewide discounts and special promo codes (e.g., `WINTER2024`) to attract new shoppers.
   - Very focused on making campaigns easy to set up and schedule. Prefers a simple dashboard or admin interface.

2. **Darius (Software Developer on the Checkout Team)**
   - Responsible for integrating any new discount functionality into the existing checkout flow.
   - Worries about performance overhead: every new service call in the checkout pipeline can slow response times and risk cart abandonment.
   - Needs a well-documented, easy-to-consume API so the new discount feature doesn’t become a maintenance nightmare.

3. **Priya (API Product Owner – *THIS IS YOU*)**
   - Tasked with developing and overseeing the new Discounts API through all APIOps phases.
   - Balances the conflicting demands of marketing, engineering, finance, and compliance.
   - Seeks to deliver an MVP quickly, but also keep the long-term roadmap in mind for potential expansions.

4. **Arun (Finance & Compliance Lead)**
   - Concerned about the potential for coupon fraud, inconsistent discount calculations, and how promotional offerings might affect profit margins.
   - Insists on robust logging, auditing, and approval workflows for certain high-value promotions.
   - Also makes sure the system can handle tax implications when applying certain types of discounts in different regions.

5. **Sasha (Operations / DevOps Manager)**
   - Oversees the infrastructure for Retail Inc., ensuring everything is scalable, secure, and efficient.
   - Prefers microservice patterns with container-based deployments to keep services decoupled and easily maintainable.
   - Wants the Discounts API to follow consistent DevOps and release processes—no exceptions.

### Scenario: Why the Discounts API Is Now Critical
- **Upcoming Campaigns**: Megan’s marketing team has a high-stakes “Winter Wonderland” campaign. They’re planning multiple discount types: flat \$5 off winter apparel, 20% off clearance items, and promotional codes for first-time customers.
- **Competitive Pressures**: Competitors have launched easy ways for their partners and affiliates to generate unique coupons. Retail Inc. wants to follow suit, enabling external partner stores or affiliates to create and track promotional codes under certain guidelines.
- **Internal Chaos**: Currently, discount logic is scattered across multiple systems (legacy ERP, custom coupons in the checkout code, and a hastily built admin tool that only the marketing team can access). This is error-prone and leads to inconsistent data and poor reporting.
- **Need for Centralized API**: By creating a single Discounts API, Retail Inc. can unify discount logic, allow all channels (website, mobile app, in-store POS, third-party affiliates) to consume discounts from one consistent source, and track usage across the board.

## 2. Requirements Derived from the Story

Below are the key requirements, broken down by storyline themes, that you must keep in mind. These requirements should guide the design, architecture, and roll-out of the Discounts API.

1. **Marketing Flexibility**
   - Megan wants to schedule discounts in advance. For instance, `WINTER2024` goes live on December 1 and ends on January 15.
   - Coupons can be percentage-based (e.g., 20% off) or amount-based (e.g., \$5 off). There might also be usage limits (e.g., only valid for the first 1,000 redemptions).
   - Megan’s team needs to easily create promotion codes for the same underlying coupon (e.g., `FIRSTBUY` and `NEWYEAR` both referencing the same discount structure).

2. **Checkout Performance & Developer Experience**
   - Darius needs a guaranteed fast response time (p95 under 200ms or better) for discount lookups during checkout.
   - The API must be well-documented: clear endpoints, request/response examples, error handling, etc.
   - Smooth integration with existing cart and payment workflows is mandatory.

3. **Financial & Compliance Oversight**
   - Arun requires an audit trail for every discount redeemed—who applied it, which order it was applied to, and at what time.
   - Must comply with local promotional regulations (e.g., some regions may have restrictions on discount stacking or minimum purchase amounts).
   - Bulk discount creation (e.g., generating 10,000 unique codes for a large partner campaign) must be carefully tracked to prevent fraud or system abuse.

4. **Technical Architecture & Scalability**
   - Sasha insists on a microservices approach: The new Discounts API must be self-contained but integrate nicely with the existing authentication and logging services.
   - Must handle high-traffic scenarios (e.g., thousands of simultaneous discount redemptions during Black Friday).
   - Should support multi-tenant usage if external partners can generate their own codes (with potential rate-limiting or usage quotas).

5. **User Experience & Self-Service**
   - The marketing team can’t rely on developers for every discount creation. They need an admin interface or a user-friendly front-end that calls the Discounts API behind the scenes.
   - Third-party affiliates or partner developers need onboarding docs, sandbox environments, and straightforward API references.

6. **Future Expansion & Roadmap**
   - Consider hooking the discount service into loyalty points or gift cards at a later stage—meaning the data models and endpoints should be flexible.
   - Possibly integrate machine-learning-driven recommendations to automatically suggest discount strategies based on inventory levels or customer segmentation.

## 3. Highlighting Key Points in the Story

### Conflict: Marketing vs. Engineering
Megan is pushing for “Winter Wonderland” to go live ASAP, possibly in under two weeks, to capture holiday shoppers. Darius, however, warns that any rushed discount deployment might compromise site stability. Priya (YOU) has to balance these demands, showing a clear MVP approach and timeline.

### Compliance Concerns
Arun has discovered that certain states in the US require disclaimers on discounts above a certain percentage. This triggers the need for a location-based discount compliance check. Additionally, European regions might require an opt-out or cancellation of subscriptions that includes reversing any applied discount.

### Technical Hiccups
Sasha’s DevOps team is strapped for time. They’re already in the middle of migrating the entire platform to a new Kubernetes cluster. They worry that adding a new microservice at this stage might complicate the deployment pipeline unless it strictly follows existing DevOps standards.

### Opportunity for Partnerships
A well-known influencer agency wants to partner with Retail Inc., providing influencer-specific promo codes. They want to generate thousands of codes at once and track them for each influencer’s marketing campaign. This partnership is a golden revenue opportunity—if the Discounts API can handle it cleanly.

## 4. Suggested Story-Driven Questions

As you go through each APIOps phase, you’ll encounter these questions that are answerable only by referencing the storyline and requirements above.

### Phase 1: API Product Strategy
1. **Stakeholder Priorities**: Given Megan’s urgency vs. Darius’s performance concerns, how do you set the initial MVP scope for the Discounts API?  
2. **KPIs**: Which metrics does Megan care about (e.g., discount redemption rate, new customer acquisition)? Which does Arun care about (e.g., fraud detection, financial impact)?  
3. **Business Model**: If Retail Inc. decides to open this API to external affiliates, what monetization or partnership model might they consider, based on the story’s influencer agency interest?

### Phase 2: API Consumer Experience
1. **Admin Workflow**: How can Megan’s marketing team easily schedule “Winter Wonderland” discount campaigns without always calling up Darius for code changes?  
2. **Third-Party Developer Flow**: The influencer agency wants to generate thousands of codes. What does the developer journey look like for bulk code creation?  
3. **Error Handling**: If a discount code is expired or has reached its usage limit, how does the user (or developer) see meaningful error messages?

### Phase 3: API Platform Architecture
1. **Service Boundaries**: Should the discount logic be a standalone microservice with its own database? How do you coordinate with the existing checkout microservice for final price calculations?  
2. **Scalability**: What is the fallback strategy during heavy traffic? Could the discount service rely on a read cache for quick lookups?  
3. **Security**: How do we ensure that only authorized marketing roles can create high-value coupons?

### Phase 4: API Design
1. **Data Modeling**: How do you model the difference between a coupon and a promotion code in the database, based on the storyline’s need for multiple codes referencing the same discount structure?  
2. **Endpoints**: Considering the storyline, we might need endpoints like `POST /bulk-promotion-codes` for the influencer agency scenario.  
3. **Versioning**: How do you plan for potential additions (like gift cards, loyalty points) without breaking existing discount endpoints?

### Phase 5: API Audit
1. **Logging & Compliance**: Given Arun’s concerns, what do we log for each discount redemption to ensure both compliance and fraud detection?  
2. **High-Risk Promotions**: Does the system require an approval workflow for promotions above a certain threshold (e.g., 50% off)?  
3. **Data Protection**: How do we handle potential personal data tied to discount usage, especially in GDPR regions?

### Phase 6: API Publishing
1. **Go-Live Strategy**: Considering the holiday timeline, do we do a soft launch for the influencer codes first, or a big bang release with “Winter Wonderland”?  
2. **Developer Portal**: What kind of quick-start guides, how-to videos, or code snippets do we offer to help partners and internal teams adopt the new service quickly?  
3. **Version Rollout**: If we roll out an MVP now, how do we communicate potential breaking changes or improvements to external partners?

### Phase 7: API Adoption
1. **Marketing Rollout**: How will Megan’s team promote these discounts to existing and new customers? Email campaigns, social media blasts, affiliate marketing?  
2. **Analytics**: Which analytics does Priya need to track daily or weekly (e.g., redemption rates, codes that are nearing usage limits)?  
3. **Continuous Feedback**: How do we capture friction points from Darius’s checkout team or from affiliate developers to refine the API?

## 5. Putting It All Together

This storyline provides the **context** you, as the API Product Owner trainee (Priya), need to reference:

- When you’re in the **Strategy** phase, recall Megan’s demands for immediate release and Darius’s warnings about checkout performance.
- When designing the **Consumer Experience**, remember that the influencer agency wants an easy way to generate thousands of codes.
- When auditing the API, keep in mind Arun’s compliance concerns.

By weaving the story’s characters, conflicts, and aspirations into each phase, you’ll learn not only the technical facets of API product development but also the soft skills of stakeholder management, prioritization, and iterative planning—skills every successful API Product Owner must master.

**Remember**: The best solutions emerge when you consider the pressures, constraints, and goals of all the stakeholders in the story!
