# API Product Strategy Phase

- "Given the customer journey you've mapped, how will this API directly address the identified pains and enhance gains at key touchpoints?"
- "Considering the API Value Proposition Canvas, what metrics will demonstrate the value of your API features to consumers (developers, partners, internal teams)?"
- "Based on the API Business Model Canvas, how will this API generate value for the business (e.g., increased revenue, reduced costs, strategic advantage)?"
- "How will your chosen API opportunity impact the customer journey, and have you considered alternatives with potentially higher impact?"
- "Have you collaborated with all relevant stakeholders to complete the API Value Proposition Canvas and align with all perspectives?"
- "Have you considered testing your assumptions of tasks, gains, and pains with actual or potential API consumers to ensure accuracy?"

# API Consumer Experience Phase

- "What specific data formats and performance requirements do your API consumers prefer, and how will you validate these assumptions?"
- "How will you ensure that the API provides a smooth onboarding experience for developers and that they have a positive first experience?"
- "Have you validated your API's value proposition with your actual or potential API consumers by asking detailed questions on preferrable data formats and performance requirements?"
- "How are you planning on translating business-level insights into actionable technical and usability requirements that prioritize developer satisfaction?"
- "Have you considered how you will build relationships with developers and other API consumers, and what support mechanisms you will use?"

---

# API Platform Architecture Phase

- "Based on the Locations of Data and Systems Canvas, are there any compliance requirements such as GDPR or data localization laws that will affect your API design, and how are you planning to handle them?"
- "Have you used the Capacity Canvas to define the expected peak loads and transaction rates that your platform needs to support?"
- "Using the Business Impact Canvas, what are the potential risks related to availability, security and functionality of your API, and what mitigation strategies are you considering?"
- "How does the existing platform architecture support the functional and non-functional requirements of the API, and what gaps do you anticipate?"
- "How will you ensure alignment between API consumer requirements and the platform's capabilities to provide seamless performance and reliability?"

---

# API Design Phase

- "Given your data requirements, how will you ensure that your API handles critical data efficiently and conforms to relevant standards (ISO, industry-specific)?"
- "Have you defined clear and consistent request and response structures, including error handling, for all API interactions?"
- "How will the design of your API facilitate future expansions, and what considerations are being made for versioning to avoid breaking changes?"
- "Have you considered how your naming standards and URI templates will promote consistency and a positive developer experience?"
- "What are the implications of choosing this specific data type, format, or standard, particularly when referring to potentially sensitive information or data?"
- "How are you planning for the scenario where an API consumer polls for data but the data has not changed on the API provider's side?"

---

# API Audit Phase

- "Based on the REST or Async API checklist, what security measures have you implemented to protect against vulnerabilities identified in the OWASP API Security Top 10?"
- "How will you ensure the API's documentation is automatically generated from the specification, and that it provides accurate and up-to-date information?"
- "How will you validate compliance with industry regulations and data localization requirements?"
- "How do the API's endpoints and attributes adhere to naming standards (e.g. descriptive, english-only) and industry standards?"

---

# API Publishing Phase

- "What support mechanisms (forums, ticketing, chat) will be in place to assist API consumers, and how will you collect their feedback?"
- "Have you created a sandbox environment where developers can test integrations and experiment with your API?"
- "How will you ensure APIs are easy to integrate into target systems, and what specific documentation, tutorials, and technical specification will be provided?"

---

# API Adoption Phase

- "What key metrics (engagement, experience, and satisfaction) will you use to track and measure the success of your API?"
- "How will you gather feedback from API consumers and use it to continuously improve the API?"
- "What are the potential barriers to adoption, and what strategies have you considered to improve the onboarding experience for API consumers?"
